  ##basics##

<- is an assignment operator
  e.g. x <- 1 means that x = 1
    note that x is a 1 element numeric vector
    msg <- "hello" means that msg is equal to hello
    must complete an expression form is x <- (your expression without      parenthesis)
the double pound symbol ## denotes a comment in r
enter a sequence of numbers with a colon with the format x <- a:b        means that it assigns the value of x, a through b.

R is object based and everything in R is an object.
  the object categories are:

  character
  numeric (real numbers)
  integer
  complex
  logical (true/false)
  
  
  
  
    ##Objects##
  
  
  The most basic object is a vector.
    A vector can only contain objects of the same class
      but: lists are an exception and can contain different objects, i         .e. each element of the list can be a diff object.
    empty vectors can be created with the vector() function.
  
  Vector function has 2 arguments (class, length)
    e.g. vector("numeric", length = 10)
    
numbers in R are numeric objects (double precision real number)
  if you want an integer you need to use the Lsuffix
    thus 1 is a numeric object while 1L is an integer
    infinity is a special number represented by Inf such as 1/Inf
    NaN represents an undefined number or missing value
    
R objects can have attributes
  the attributes are:
    names, dimnames
    dimensions
    class
    length
    other user-defined
      attributes of an object can be accessed using the attributes()           function
      
      
You can convert one object to another with the as function.
  e.g. 
  x <- 0:6   is an integer function you can convert it to a numeric function with
  as.numeric(x)


  ##vectors##
  
    List of vector functions. All vector functions can be created with  function in this format c(a, b)
    
      numeric x <- c(0.5, 0.6)
      logical x <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
      CHARACTER <- c("a", "b", "c")
      integer <- c(9:29)
      complex <- c(1+0i, 2+4i)

      vector function is vector()
        x <- vector("numeric", length = 10)
        
A matrix is a special type of vector with dimensions

  e.g.m <- matrix (nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
  matrices are constructed by column (vertically)
  
  if you add the dimension attribute to a vector you can create a dimensino
  dim(m)<- c(2, 5)
  
  can also create a matrix with cbind and rbind
  x <- 1:13
  y <- 10:12
  
  cbind (x, y) creates a standard matrix of x and y indexed by column
  rbind (x, y) creates a matrix for which the elements are indexed by row (1, 2, 3)
  
  you can name the elements of your matrix with format
  dimnames(m) <- list(c("a", "b"), c("c", "d")) and this will name the elements in the order they are assigned so if     you go row column then you'll have row a, b and column c, d. If you go column row then you'll have column a, b       and row c, d.
  
  names(x) can be used to name the elements of a vector so you could have an element with
    names(x) <- c("todd", "dick", "harry")
    this would assign the values 1, 2, and 3 the names todd, dick, and harry
  
  ##List##
List entries are printed with the index label in double brackets so index 1 is [[1]]
  lists can hold objects of different classes
  a list can be given names thus a list of 1, 2, and 3  could be given names a, b, c with this format
    x <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
  
        
        
  ##Factors##
  
for categorical data, storing ordered data with labels ie such as a ranking. unordered data would be labeled for instance as male, female.

  the factor function is x<- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"))
  
  this prints out to 
  [1] yes yes no yes no
  Levels: no yes
        
  table(x) will print the frequency count of the levels
  
  unclass(x) will strip the class and turns it into an unlabled integer vector
  
  you can set the levels with the levels function
  levels = c("yes", "no")
    levels are set by R in alfabetical order the levels function can be used to change that
    
    ##Data Frames##
    
Used for tabular data
  represented of a special list where every element of the list has the same length but does not need to be
    the same type
  special attribute row.name, every row has a name
  they are created by calling read.table() or read.csv()
  can create a matrix from a dataframe with data.matrix()
    basic format:
      x <- data.frame(foo = 1:4, bar = c(T, T, F, F))
        This creates a data fram with 1 column and 4 rows represented by the 1 to 4. The column is named foo and the           rows are named bar
        
        
        
   ##reading stored data##
   
these functions can read data from stored text files and the analagous write function.
  tabluar data
    read.table / write.table
    read.csv 
    
  reading lines of a file
    readLines / writeLines
    
  reading R code files
    source/dump
    
  reading R code files
    dget/dput
    
  reading saved workspace
    load/save
    
  reading single R objects in binary form
    unserialize/serialize
    
              command line function arguments
                read.table
                file
                  name of a file or connection
                header
                  logical indicating if the file has a heaer line
                sep
                  a string indicating how the columns are separated
                colClasses
                  a character vector indicating the class of each column in the dataset
                nrows
                  the number of rows in a dataset
                comment.char
                  a character string indicating the comment character
                skip
                  the number of ines to skip from the beginning
                stringAsFactors
                  should character variables be coded as factors?
                  
                example:
                read.table(stringAsFactors = False)
                
                
      use colClasses to assign the data type of each column which makes R run much faster with big data sets.
        
        easy way to determine the class of each object column is the following block of code:
            initial <- read.table("datatable.txt", nrwos = 100)
            classes <-sapply(initial, class)
            tabAll <-read.table("datatable.txt", colClasses = classes)
      
      dump and dput      
        dump and dput retain metadata
        format dput(file = "y.R")
          dput(file ="filename")
